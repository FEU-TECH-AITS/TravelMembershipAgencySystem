## Overview

**Basic Input, Output, and Conditionals** is a C++ program designed to simulate a membership system for travel bookings. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on members of the system, each of whom can book travel by land, water, or air. The system uses a simple menu-driven interface and manages data through a linked list.

### Key Features

- **Add a New Member**: Register a new member and store their travel data.
- **List All Members**: Display all registered members and their travel information.
- **Update Member Data**: Modify the data of an existing member.
- **Delete Member**: Remove a member from the system.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implements basic Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality.
